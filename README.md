# Crossed Keys
Crossed Keys implements a web app for generating and displaying boards/rooms for the Codenames board game. 
Generated boards are shareable and will update as words are revealed. The board can be viewed either as a spymaster or an ordinary player, and can be played with other players by joining the same room.
